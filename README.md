# 🛡️ CKS Security Labs & GitOps Portfolio
---
Welcome to my Kubernetes Security GitOps portfolio. This repository demonstrates real-world security implementations using GitOps workflows with Argo CD. It includes production-ready CKS-level labs that showcase security-as-code practices and automated policy enforcement.

---

📋 Portfolio Overview
---
This repository serves as both a CKS preparation lab and a professional GitOps security portfolio, featuring:

20+ practical security labs covering CKS exam objectives

Complete GitOps workflow with Argo CD for declarative security management

Production-ready security policies (Kyverno, PSA, NetworkPolicies)

Automated security scanning integrated into GitOps pipelines

Real-world attack scenarios with corresponding defenses

---

🛡️ Security Topics Covered
---

🔐 GitOps Security
---
Argo CD Implementation: Multi-app management with sync policies and self-healing

Policy-as-Code: Git-based Kyverno policy enforcement with automatic synchronization

Security-as-Code: All security configurations managed declaratively through Git

Drift Prevention: Automated remediation of configuration deviations

---

✅ CKS Exam Domains
---
Domain	Implementation
Cluster Setup	Hardened kubeadm clusters with containerd
System Hardening	CIS benchmarks with kube-bench, minimized OS footprint
Cluster Hardening	RBAC, Pod Security Admission, network policies
Supply Chain Security	Cosign image verification, SBOM generation with Syft
Runtime Security	Falco runtime detection, Seccomp, AppArmor profiles
Monitoring & Logging	Audit logging, Prometheus/Grafana, Falco alerts

---

---

🔄 GitOps Workflow
---
This repository implements a complete GitOps security workflow:

```text
Security Policy Development → Policies written as YAML in Git

Pull Request Review → Security team reviews changes

Automated Testing → Policies validated before merging

Argo CD Synchronization → Changes automatically deployed

Continuous Monitoring → Falco detects policy violations

Self-Healing → Argo CD corrects configuration drift
```

---

🎯 Professional Applications
---

The patterns in this repository are directly applicable to:

Enterprise Kubernetes Security - Production-ready security baselines

DevSecOps Pipelines - Integrated security in CI/CD

Compliance Frameworks - Meeting PCI DSS, HIPAA, SOC2 requirements

Incident Response - Pre-built security controls and monitoring

Security Training - Hands-on labs for team upskilling

---

📈 Impact Metrics
---
Implementations in this portfolio have demonstrated:

90% reduction in manual security configuration

100% Git-managed security policies

Minutes vs. days for security policy deployment

Zero configuration drift with Argo CD self-healing

Automated compliance reporting and validation
